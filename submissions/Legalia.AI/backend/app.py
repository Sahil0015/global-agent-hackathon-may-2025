            **Case Description:** TechNova Inc. alleges that a former employee leaked proprietary AI model architectures to a competitor, Quantum Solutions. The plaintiff claims that this leak resulted in financial losses and compromised competitive advantage.
                     
            **Plaintiff:** TechNova Inc.
            
            **Accused:** Alex Morgan (Quantum Solutions)
            
            **Evidence Examples:**
            - Internal emails retrieved from Alex Morgan's company account showing communication with Quantum Solutions while still employed at TechNova.
            - A USB drive containing confidential architecture files found in Alex's personal belongings during a security audit.
            - Download logs from TechNova's internal server indicating large data transfers from Alex's account shortly before resignation.
            
            **Witness Examples:**
            - Sarah Kim (CTO, TechNova Inc.): "Alex was part of the restricted-access team and had full visibility into our next-gen AI project. He had no reason to download those files unless he intended to misuse them."
            - Dr. Raj Patel (Cybersecurity Analyst): "Our investigation shows that the files accessed match the confidential model specifications now seen in Quantum's new product line."
            - Alex Morgan (Accused): "The files in question were part of my assigned work. I did not share or misuse them, and Quantum's models were developed independently."
